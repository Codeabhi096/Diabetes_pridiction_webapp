# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App

A simple and interactive machine learning web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in an individual based on key medical parameters.

Built using **Python**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model, and **Streamlit**, this app is designed to be fast, intuitive, and helpful for early detection.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Predicts diabetes based on user input
- 🧠 Machine Learning model: **SVM**
- 📈 Model Accuracy: **78%**
- 📊 Trained on **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**
- 🌐 Interactive web interface built using **Streamlit**
- 💾 Lightweight and easy to deploy

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters medical parameters such as:
   - Pregnancies
   - Glucose level
   - Blood Pressure
   - Skin Thickness
   - Insulin
   - BMI
   - Diabetes Pedigree Function
   - Age

2. The data is passed to a **trained SVM model**

3. The model outputs either:
   - ✅ **Non-Diabetic**
   - ⚠️ **Diabetic**

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Streamlit  
- scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook (for model training)
